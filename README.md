# All you need is Java

Sample application with a backend in Java, a frontend in Java and being displayed in a webview.

Because ***all you need is Java***.

Also, somehow, TailwindCSS is involved in this mess of a repository.

## Update!

I got pointed to [Webview](https://github.com/webview/webview_java) which is a much better solution than JavaFX.

This repository was updated to use Webview instead of JavaFX.
